# Terminal Snake

### Introduction
This was a project I mostly made just to help learn rust and to understand different rust datatypes.

When you launch terminal snake it shows a splash screen where you can see a leaderboard and start the game. Once you start it it brings you into the game

### Screenshots

Coming soon! Once I finish implementing drawing of the entire snake body I'll Update this


### Installing

Once I finish this project I plan on releasing a .deb file for linux but I'm not sure if I'll make a macos release
