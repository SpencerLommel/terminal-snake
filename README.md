### Terminal Snake

## Introduction
This was a project I mostly made just to help learn rust and to understand different rust datatypes.

## Screenshots

Coming soon! Once I finish implementing drawing of the entire snake body I'll Update this


## Installing

Once I finish this project I plan on releasing a .deb file for linux but I'm not sure if I'll make a macos release
